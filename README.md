**Rhytmious** is simple yet user-friendly metronome for Windows. Written just for fun in C# (with some Win32 API magic). Compiled using Visual Studio 2019.\
Developed by me from March to April of 2023 year. Released in public domain - see [UNLICENSE.txt](UNLICENSE.txt) for further details.\
That's all folks :)
